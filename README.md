# async-chain-lighthouse

Uses Google's lighthouse (https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) to build a set of reports from the URL list you pass into the configuration file.

It's a Node.JS script, so you need Node / NPM installed on your machine.

# Setup

After cloning the repo, run 

`npm install`

to install the dependencies.

# Run

Once you've set it up, you can run the audit tool with

`node index.js`

The process will be logged into the console.
